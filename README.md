# Warning

If you are reading this GO AWAY. Just kidding, but right now the addon doesn't
work. Kodi seems to have trouble dealing with the audio stream. More
investigation is required. Now to what hopefully one day will be the real
readme...

# TSN Go Kodi Addon

The TSN Go Kodi addon -- play TSN live streams with your TSN Go (or Cable
provider) account. Uses inputstream.adaptive to play the video.

**NOTE**: This addon will probably die a quick and painless death. Unlike
Sportsnet, TSN doesn't really have an API -- its more of a Rube Goldberg style
series of calls that somehow result in video playback. Compatibility with any
external platform (let alone their own player) doesn't seem like much of a
priority for them and in all likelihood, the burden of maintenance will be too
high. Don't get too attached!
