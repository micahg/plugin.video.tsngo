# TSN Go Kodi Addon

The TSN Go Kodi addon -- play TSN live streams with your TSN Go (or Cable
provider) account. Uses inputstream.adaptive to play the video.

**NOTE**: This addon will probably die a quick and painless death. Unlike
Sportsnet, TSN doesn't really have an API -- its more of a Rube Goldberg style
series of calls that somehow result in video playback. Compatibility with any
external platform (let alone their own player) doesn't seem like much of a
priority for them and in all likelihood, the burden of maintenance will be too
high. Don't get too attached!

## What Works

* Some streams
  * after it fails the first time... this can be fixed
  * some streams don't play -- needs further investigation

## TODO
* Fix all streams
* Add loading popups
* Add error popups
